    C O N S T A N T S :
    Literal/Constants  are those whose value can't be canged during the 
    execution of the program. in other words we can say that these are fixed values.

    It is used where we want to fix value that can't be changed. When we try to change 
    its value gives an error stating Constants values can't be changed.

    Syntax for declaring a constants :
         Using "const" keyword followed by data type and variable name.
                        const int a = 10;


    S Y M B O L I C    C O N S T A N T S :  
    If we want to create a constant having a specified name and can be used anywhere in the program
    then we use the concept of symbolic constant.
    Symbolic constants are not stored in memory, they are replaced with their respective values at compile time.

    Syntax : #define name value
                      ex : #define PI 3.1415
                           #define name "arti chaudhary" 

    Note :
            1) Every symbolic constant starts with #define.
            2) Usually the constant name is in upper case.
            3) No semi colon is there at the end.

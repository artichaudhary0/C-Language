/*
    V A R I A B L E :
    A variable is one which stores some value and its value can be changed at any point of time.
    A variable is also an identifier so rule for naming identifiers also applies here.
    Declaring a variable : 
    int a;
    long int amount;
    int a,b,c;
    float a,b,c;

    Now, after declaring a variable we can put any value to it like:
    int a;
    a= 5;
    float b;
    b=50.5;
    char c;
    c = "%";
